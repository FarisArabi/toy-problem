//A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no divisors other than itself and 1.
//Write a function that accepts a number and returns true if itâ€™s a prime number, false if itâ€™s not.
//The grader is looking at the efficiency of your solution (number of operations) as well as correctness! 
//Input: n=2
//Output:true
//Input:1
//Output:false
